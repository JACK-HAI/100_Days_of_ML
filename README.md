# 100_Days_of_ML

This is 100 days of Machine Learning challenge as instructed by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code) #learningbydoing

# Motivation

Machine Learning is the most transformative technology of our time. Whether its helping us discover new drugs for major diseases, fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless. In order for us as a community to be able to make valuable contributions to the world, we need to master this technology. This is a call to action, a battle cry, a spark that will light a movement to radically improve the state of humanity. 100 Days of ML Code is a commitment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

# Daily Log

It's the daily log to keep track on my progress.

# Day 1 : June 25, 2020 | Overview

 1. Today I got the overview of Machine Learning Algorithms with the Mind-maps and Cheat sheets.
 2. Set up the environment(anaconda.org) to complete this challenge and also completed choosing the courses I will follow.

# Day 2 : June 26, 2020 | Linear Regression

 1. Learnt the basics of Linear Regression and revisited the Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng in Coursera. Alternative free course - [Stanford YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b4MUYve_U8&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&index=3&t=2218s)
 2. Implemented Linear Regression without using popular Libraries and Frameworks on the 'bike_sharing_data.csv'.

# Day 3 : June 27, 2020 | Logistic Regression

 1. Learnt the basic intuition of Logistic Regression and enrolled to the [guided project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/logistic-regression-numpy-python) on Logistic Logistic Regression.
 2. Implemented Logistic Regression using Python.
